# firebase_flutter_chat_app

A one-to-one chat developed using Flutter and Firebase Cloud Firestore. It has the capability of sending written messages, videos and images. It can accurately keep track of the time stamps and read receipts for each message. This can be applied to your app by providing a collection reference where all messages are stored and a storage reference where images and videos are stored.

Please find in this respository the Dart code used for the Flutter UI and the Typescript code used for some Cloud Function triggers

Open to contribution.
